    <h1>Adding the images</h1>

    <p>
      Our objective will to add an image to the sprtie of the entity of the previous tutorial.
    </p>
    <h2>Rewind to the entity initialization</h2>
    <div> let mySquare = new Entity({onupdate: (e) => {...}, src: "myImage.png"})</div>
    <p>
        Because the writer of this documentation was to lazy, keep in mind that the ... is a replacement for the onupdate function of the previous tutorial.
        To add an image, just add src which stands for source. This is where you put your path relative to the html file. Remember that the path always needs to be a string.
        That's it! This is how you add an image to the entity. Don't forget to remove the size and the color because they are now useless.
