    <h1>Game</h1>

    <p>
      Learn how to exploit the full potential of the game object.
    </p>
    
    <h2>All the available options</h2>
    <h3>
        fps, ups, aps and ops
    </h3>
    <p>
        That's right, you can choose the frames per second (fps), the updates per second (ups), the sprite animations per second (aps) and finally the optimizations per second (ops).
        More information on aps and ops coming right up.
    </p>
    <div>
        let mySpecialGame = new Game({fps: 30, ups: 30, aps: 5, ops: 2})
    </div>
    <p>
        Don't forget to deconstruct D2PX!
    </p>
    <h3>optimize</h3>
    <p>A true or false option which toggles the optimization of the game. It makes the game run around 5 to 10 times faster. It is on by default.</p>
    <div>
        let mySpecialGame = new Game({optimize: true})
    </div>
    <h3>
        onrender, onupdate, onplay, onanimate, onoptimize, onpause
    </h3>
    <p>
        Is called when the respective event happens. The value will the a function, therefore we call it a callback function.
    </p>
    <div>
        let myGame = new Game({onplay: (e) => {console.log("The game has started")}})
    </div>
    <h3>
        canvas
    </h3>
    <p>
        Only use it if you want to make a custom canvas. 
    </p>

    <div>
        let myCustomCanvasGame = new Game({canvas: myHTMLCanvas})
    </div>

    <h2>All methods</h2>
    <h3>update, render, animate, optimize</h3>
    <p>Call it if only you want to force its execution.</p>
    <h3>play, pause</h3>
    <p>play starts the game and pause stops the game from rendering, updating, animating and optimizing</p>
    <div>
        myGame.play() <br>
        myGame.pause()
    </div>
    <h3>setScene, setGui</h3>
    <p>Set scene selects the scene that you want to update, render, animate, and optimize. Same goes for the setGui, but for the GUI object.</p>
    <div>myGame.setScene(myScene)</div>
    <h3>playScene, pauseScene</h3>
    <p>pauseScene only stops the updating of the selected scene. playScene resumes it.</p>
    <div>myGame.pauseScene()<br>myGame.playScene()</div>
