    <h1>What is D2PX?</h1>
    <p>
      D2PX is a game library specialized in making 2D pixelated games with efficiency and ease.
    </p>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Its structure is relatively simple. Each D2PX game contains a Game object which renders a scene. The scene itself contains entities. The
      entseities may as well contain other entities, but they will always contain a bound object and a sprite object.
    </p>
    <h2>Relative positioning</h2>
    <p>
      All entities will hative pos relativeition to their parents during the initialization to simplify sub-component movements.
    </p>
    <h1>All the object types</h1>
    <p>
      This game engine is indeed object oriented. Therefore, it contains a large variety of objects all having a very important role in this code
      ecosystem.
    </p>
    <h2>Game</h2>
    <p>
      The game object is the object that will run your game. More precisely, it's the instance that will render and update the selected scene at a
      certain framerate.
    </p>
    <h2>Scene</h2>
    <p>The scene object is the object that will render and update your entities. It will also be the one holding the camera object.</p>
    <h2>Entity</h2>
    <p>
      The entity object contains its sub-entities along with its own sprite (aka graphics). Only entities can contain boudaries for rectangular
      collision detection.
    </p>
    <h2>Sprite</h2>
    <p>
      The Sprite object is the one that will render the graphics for your entity. It can only render rectangular shapes, text and images of your
      choice.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Bounds
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bounds object is responsible for the collision of your entity.
    </p>
    <h2>Vector</h2>
    <p>Everything related to position and size will be stored inside a Vector object.</p>
    <h2>Camera</h2>
    <p>This object is responsible for moving the players view.</p>
